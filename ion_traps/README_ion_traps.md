# Ion trap designs and realizations

## Background

Ion-traps come in several designs, depending on the main application. Historically, ion-traps consisted of a three-dimensional set of elements:
* 4 rods of blades in an elongated mount (two connected to RF, and two connected to ground), providing radial confinement,
* and two end-caps (both connected to high voltage), providing axial confirement.

These traps allowed the storage of both individual ions and clouds of ions. However, as people wanted to trap and control a growing number of ions, the segmentation of electrodes from the initial design became necessary.
