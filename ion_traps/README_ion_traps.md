# Ion trap designs and realizations

## Background

Ion-traps come in several designs, depending on the main application. Historically, ion-traps consisted of a three-dimensional set of elements:
* 4 rods of blades in an elongated mount (two connected to RF, and two connected to ground), providing radial confinement,
* and two end-caps (both connected to high voltage), providing axial confirement.

These traps allowed the storage of both individual ions and clouds of ions. However, as people wanted to trap and control a growing number of ions, the segmentation of electrodes from the initial design became necessary.

## Definitions and Nomenclatur

## Simulation suite

Certification of traps requires simulations of the respective electric and magnetic fields (including the full mount, vacuum chamber, etc) to ensure that requirements for health-care are met. Furthermore, the simulations need to be cross-checked with experimentally obtained data, before any kind of certification can proceed. More details on best-practices regarding the recommended simulations to predict the performance of ion-traps can be found [here](ion_trap_simulation_suite.md)
